# Data Snippets  
Snippets of code mainly from Data Analysis projects.  
## 1. Outcome Distribution of Coin Flips:  
   A Python program that lets you flip a coin once, or as many times as you want.  
   A great way to visualise the law of large numbers in probability theory.
   Included is a bar graph to visualise the data. The more flips you do, the more evenly distibuted the outcome!  
   When you flip a coin only a few times, chance can result in considerable variation in outcomes. For instance, in 10 flips, it's possible but improbable to get all heads.   
   Yet, with 10,000 flips, random fluctuations balance out, aligning the observed frequencies of heads and tails closer to the theoretical probability of 0.5.   
   This illustrates the law of large numbers theory nicely!  
## 2. The Scone Debate:  
   Whilst studying, the Tutor asked the group "Which goes on first, the cream or the jam - or does it matter?"  
   Personally, I prefer any as long as there are no raisins in it.  
   - The Class Data was tallied and entered into Jupyter Notebook with Matplotlib to visualise the data into a Bar Graph and a Pie Chart.
